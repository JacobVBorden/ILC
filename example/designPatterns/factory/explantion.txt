The factor pattern allows for you to create objects with out knowing their concrete classes. This uses an Abstract Super class with a "create" method that each
child class implements. The child classes then call the appropriate constructor. This also requires the objects being constructed to have a interface to ensure
each has similar funtionality. In this case, Cats is the Interface that Lion and HouseCat share and Feline is the Constructor class. This pattern allows 
you to easily and quickly add new objects to a heiracy with out having to worry about updating your code to construct the new object.
