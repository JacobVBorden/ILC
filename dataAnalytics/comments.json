I wanted to address a concern that has been on my mind lately - the overwhelming amount of chatgpt content being posted on this subreddit. Don't get me wrong, I enjoy a good chatgpt joke just as much as the next person, but it feels like every other post on this subreddit is a chatgpt conversation.\n\nI understand that chatgpt can be amusing and provide a quick laugh, but it's starting to feel like it's taking over the entire subreddit. It's becoming difficult to find any other type of programming humor amidst all the chatgpt.\n\nI'm not saying that chatgpt should be banned or anything like that, but I think it would be great if we could mix things up a bit and bring in some other types of programming humor too. There are so many other hilarious and relatable aspects of being a programmer that we could be sharing and laughing about.\n\nSo, I'm just asking for a little variety. Let's not forget about the other types of programming humor out there and try to mix things up a bit. I'm sure we can all come up with some great new ideas for posts that will make this subreddit even more enjoyable for everyone.\n\nThanks for considering my request. Happy coding!"

Instead of checking every single byte looking for 0 (null terminator), they do some tricks to check multiple bytes at a time.  I think some of them even use inline assembly.\n\nI was curious if the compiler could optimize this to use some of those same tricks so I plugged into into Godbolt.  It turns out the compiler is smart enough to realize what you're doing... and just calls the standard strlen() for you.  https://godbolt.org/z/KW8hqqza4"

At the time I had a colleague in Sheffield who was also interested in C, so I zipped the compiler disks and sent them off to him over the internal email system. The attachment was, IIRC, around 3Mb?

For example, a commit message like \"Fixed bug in login form\" would be more informative and helpful than \"Fixed shit.\"\n\nThat being said, the specific conventions and standards for commit messages can vary from project to project, so it's always a good idea to check with your team or project guidelines to see what is expected."

For example:\n\n> const name = \"<img src='x' onerror='alert(1)'>\";\nel.innerHTML = name; // shows the alert\nCopy to ClipboardCopy to Clipboard\n\n> For that reason, it is recommended that instead of innerHTML you use:\n\n> Element.SetHTML() to sanitize the text before it is inserted into the DOM.\n\n> Node.textContent when inserting plain text, as this inserts it as raw text rather than parsing it as HTML\n\nEdit: formatting"

Didn't like how React is, feels very messy and forced. Coming from Angular it felt very stupid at the time, also they kept changing things from class to hooks, to context provider, then toolkit.

If anything, if you think it just sucks, then that says more about your ability to use that tool than it does about the tool itself.\n\nThe issue is people want to treat it as an all knowing problem solver, which it certainly isn't. But if you know how to use it, it can speed up your workflow substantially, and I'm not specifically talking about programming.\n\nIn it's current state, it's far better at augmenting your current ability rather than working on it's own. That may well change in GPT4, but in general ML models are always at their best when they're augmenting someone or something else. Be it a programmer who already mostly knows what they're doing, but want's to save time, or a program that needs a component that's creative, good at pattern recognition or needing an interface to work with people in a dynamic way. In my opinion anyway.\n\nAt the end of the day, ML isn't true AI, so don't use it expecting it to work as an AI, use it for what it's good at. It's kinda like using a monkey wrench to loosen a normal bolt, you can usually sort of do it, but it's going to cause problems and it's certainly not designed with that in mind."

ChatGPT is a variant of the GPT (Generative Pretrained Transformer) language model that was specifically designed for conversational modeling. It is a machine learning model that uses a combination of pattern recognition and natural language processing to generate responses to user input.\n\nThere are a few things to consider when evaluating a language model like ChatGPT:\n\nTraining data: The quality and quantity of the data used to train a language model can significantly impact its performance.\n\nModel architecture: The design of the model, including the number of layers and the type of attention mechanism used, can also affect performance.\n\nEvaluation criteria: Different language models may excel in different tasks or domains, so it's important to consider the specific criteria being used to evaluate the model's performance.\n\nIt's also worth noting that language models, including ChatGPT, are designed to assist with generating text, but they are not intended to be a replacement for human conversation. They are still limited by the data they were trained on and may not always produce responses that are relevant or appropriate.\n\nI hope this helps give some context on language models like ChatGPT and how they work. Is there anything else I can help with?"

It has the ability to generate human-like text, which can be useful in many situations, such as generating responses to customer inquiries, summarizing long articles, or even creating creative writing.\n\nThere are several reasons why GPT-3 does not \"suck\":\n\nIt can save time and effort: GPT-3 can complete tasks that would otherwise be time-consuming for humans to do, such as transcribing audio recordings or summarizing long documents. This can be especially useful in situations where there is a large volume of work to be done.\n\nIt can be accurate: GPT-3 has been trained on a massive amount of data and can often generate accurate text. For example, it can accurately translate text from one language to another or generate accurate summaries of articles.\n\nIt can be flexible: GPT-3 can perform a wide range of language tasks and can be fine-tuned to perform specific tasks or generate text in a specific style. This flexibility makes it a useful tool in a variety of applications.\n\nOverall, while GPT-3 is not perfect and has its limitations, it is a powerful tool that can be useful in many situations. It is important to use it appropriately and be aware of its limitations, but it does not \"suck\" in the sense that it is a poor or useless tool.\n\n\nAnd yes, I used it for this"

However, it's important to remember that language models are just tools, and the usefulness of a tool depends on how it is used and the specific task it is being applied to.\n\nThere are many factors that can affect the performance of a language model, such as the quality and quantity of the training data, the size and architecture of the model, and the specific task it is being used for. ChatGPT is a large language model that has been trained on a very large dataset and is designed to generate human-like text. It can be used for a variety of tasks, including generating responses to prompts, completing text, and generating natural language descriptions.\n\nOverall, it's important to evaluate the performance of any language model in the context of the specific task you are trying to accomplish, and to consider other factors that might be affecting its performance. It's also important to remember that no single model is going to be the best at every task, and that the best approach may involve using a combination of different models and techniques."

However, some people have argued that ChatGPT \"sucks\" and is not worth using.\n\nHere are a few reasons why this argument is misguided:\n\nChatGPT is a powerful tool for generating text, but it is not intended to replace human writers. It is a tool that can assist writers in generating ideas, proofreading, and providing inspiration. It should not be used as a replacement for human creativity and skill.\n\nChatGPT is trained on a massive dataset of human-generated text, which means that it has learned to generate text that is similar to human language. However, it is still a machine and it can make mistakes or generate text that is not completely accurate. It is important to use ChatGPT as a tool and not rely on it completely.\n\nChatGPT has a wide range of applications, including language translation, question answering, and generating content for websites and social media. It can save time and effort for businesses and individuals who need to generate large amounts of text or perform language tasks.\n\nIn conclusion, ChatGPT is a valuable tool that can assist with language tasks, but it should not be relied upon as a replacement for human writers or proofreaders. It is important to use ChatGPT responsibly and understand its limitations."

I've experienced this first hand at my last job where applications were thrown away en masse and yet I got in without even applying through something written at all.\nThrough diploma mills, dubious code camps and other \"become a developer quick\" schemes, you have a bottom layer of uninteresting applicants that do or have nothing about them that stand out. My old job straight up rejected applications without even looking at them unless they had a degree in computer science directly, not a combo degree, not \"business IT\", etc, certainly nothing from a code camp, those were all rejected without even reading the rest.\nIn the mind of these companies, above the aforementioned, you have the people that are very sought after.\n\nWhether you think you belong to either group, make sure the places you apply to understand you as belonging to the second group. Assume that anything you HAD to do, because it was an assignment or because it was mandatory in another way is completely useless, but put triple emphasis on everything you did voluntarily. Anything that shows you did more than just what you were asked for. \n\nI can't help much else without having more information.
